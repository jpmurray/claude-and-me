# Frontend Development

## Blade Templates

- Use Blade components for reusable UI elements.
- Use Blade layouts for consistent page structure.
- Use translation functions for internationalization.
- Use proper indentation and formatting for readability.

## Livewire's Flux

- Use Livewire's Flux library for components as much as possible. Use context7 (context7/fluxui_dev) to understand the possibilities.

## CSS and JavaScript

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Always try to implement both light and dark mode with Tailwind.
- Use Alpine.js for frontend interactivity if not using a Flux component.
- Use Laravel Vite for asset compilation.
- Follow the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology for custom CSS.
- Use ES6+ features for JavaScript.

## Tailwind CSS Guidelines

- Use utility classes over custom CSS
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Use consistent spacing scale
- Leverage Tailwind's color palette
- Use component classes for repeated patterns

## Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML elements.
- Use ARIA attributes for enhanced accessibility.
- Ensure proper color contrast for text.
- Ensure keyboard navigation works correctly.
- Test with screen readers and other assistive technologies.
